Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure deadlines are met?
-It is crucial because it has an effect on client satisfaction, keeps overall cost within budget, and maintain a coherent and well-functioning 
development team. Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by using project management tools such as Gantt chart that visually demonstrates a project plan, it helps track the progress of the project.   

How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
-It contributes by ensuring that software development is kept within the bugdet and schedule constraints that are set by the organisation developing the software.
Strategies: Accurate cost estimation, clear project scope, regular cost monitoring, and resource leveling.

Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
1. Agile
Advantage: Flexible, iterative, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements, and it is easier to get customer feedback on the development work that has been done. 
Disadvantage: System structure tends to degrade as new increments are added and the process is not visible, managers need regular deliverables to measure 
progress.  
2. Waterfall
Advantage: It is plan-driven model, separate and distinct phases of specification and development.
Disadvantage: Inflexible, it is difficulty of accommodating change after the process is underway.

In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
1. Agile: The agile model is mostly used for dynamic, user-driven, and evolving projects that require flexibility. (e.g Mobile app startup)
2. Waterfall: The waterfall model is mostly used for large systems engineering projects where a system is developed at several sites. (e.g. Government software project)

What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
-Methods such as requirement analysis, risk management, automated testing, and code reviw. 
Importance: It enhances user experience and usability, improves security, reduces costs, and increases reliability. 

How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
-The project scope assist in setting clear context and what constraints are imposed as a result of the context, What customer-visible data objects are 
produced as output from the software and what data objects are required for input, and  What function does the software perform to transform input data into output.
WBS: It is partitioning the project into smaller and managable task, making it easier to organize and track work.

What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
-It allows progress tracking, assigning team mates to tasks, and provides an easy project timeline.
Gantt chart: Helps visualize tasks and clearly shows the task start and finish dates.  

What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
-The issues of accessibility or inefficiency. They are significant because addressing them will result to accessibility to services high usability and improve user experience. 

How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
-The clear definition of a problem ensures accurate requiment gathering that will help in developing a system that will address the needs of users, reduces ambiguity,  leading to better project planning.

How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
-The software solution is designed to be error free, easy to use, easy to understand, and effective to end users. 

What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
-The software that includes an easy to navigate user interface, authomation and AI integration, and security and privacy.

What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
